I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate computer engineering degree, at the University of Florida. The name of my major is Digital Arts and Sciences(DAS). This is a specialized program, which integrates engineering and design to create software that is computationally complex, user friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. Some of my main interests include computer graphics, multimedia production, music, and software/game development. Throughout my life, I've been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology, and I cant wait to be a part of the evolving field of creative computing.</p><br><br></div>
